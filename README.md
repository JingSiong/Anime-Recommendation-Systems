# Anime-Recommendation-Systems
# About
This is a mini project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on recommending animes to viewers. Overview of source code:
1. Data Preparation and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Machine Learning Models

# Problem Definition
How can we amidst the enormous library of animes, recommend quality animes according to viewersâ€™ preference?
Can we accurately predict the score of an anime and classify it as a top show?

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate Visualisation 
1. Catplots for categorical variables
2. Histograms for numerical variables

Through univariate visualtion, we managed to identify variables such as 'Type' which do not play a significant role in predicting the score and removed them. 

Predictors vs Score
1. Boxplot and Stripplot for categorical predictors
2. Correlation matrix for numerical predictors 

# Machine Learning Models

Predicting anime score using chosen variables 
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest Classification

Item-based Collaborative Filtering 
3. K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
4. 4. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
5. Evaluation of these two models using 5-Fold cross validation and train-test split

# Insights and recommendation 
1. Random forest classification is a more accurate and better model than decision tree 
2. Singular Value Decomposition algorithm has a lower error and is more accurate than the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm 
3. Venture into user-based collaborative filtering
